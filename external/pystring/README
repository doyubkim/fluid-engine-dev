Pystring is a collection of C++ functions which match the interface and behavior of python's string class methods using std::string. Implemented in C++, it does not require or make use of a python interpreter. It provides convenience and familiarity for common string operations not included in the standard C++ library. It's also useful in environments where both C++ and python are used.

Overlapping functionality (such as index and slice/substr) of std::string is included to match python interfaces.
