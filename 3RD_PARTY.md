Jet uses portion of Marching Cubes Example Program by Cory Bloyd

Marching Cubes Example Program
by Cory Bloyd (corysama@yahoo.com)

A simple, portable and complete implementation of the Marching Cubes
and Marching Tetrahedrons algorithms in a single source file.
There are many ways that this code could be made faster, but the
intent is for the code to be easy to understand.

For a description of the algorithm go to
http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/modelling/polygonise/

This code is public domain.
